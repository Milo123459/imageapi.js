**Firstly, what does imageapi.js do?** <br>
**imageapi.js is the easy way to grab a random image straight from a subreddit of your choice!**
<br>
Here is an example of how it works!
<br>

```js
const imageapi = require("imageapi.js");
//It has to be an async function
async function test() {
  let img = await imageapi("meme", true); // The second param is for verbose logging, completely optional. Place false if you don't want or you can leave it blank.
  console.log(img);
}
test();
```

This example would grab an image from r/meme <br>
